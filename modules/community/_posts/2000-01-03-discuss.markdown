# Discuss

## What will community look like for your course? Discuss on discourse

Now that you've done a little community building and saw how others to it, reflect on what community will ideally look like in your course.

- How will people join your community? 
- What type of community will you build for your course? 
- Will it be a community of interest, practice or inquiry? 
- Will you add a personality/theme to your community? 
- Will the community keep going after the course is done?

Share your thoughts on the [discourse topic](http://community.p2pu.org/) you created earlier.

## Hangout

We will also have a [hangout](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/h/course-in-a-box) to share our answers to the questions about and talk how we can apply it to our courses. Have a look at the calender on the front page to see when the hangout about community is happening.
