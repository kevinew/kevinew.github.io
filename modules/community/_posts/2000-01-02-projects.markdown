## Find and Invite Folks to be Your 'First 10'

Building a course alone is a daunting task. We guarantee that co-designing with a crew makes for a [more successful online community](http://jolt.merlot.org/vol9no2/ahn_0613.htm). To wit, we invite you to:

- Start a new topic on discourse under the [new courses](http://community.p2pu.org/c/new-courses) category to tell people about the course you are building.
- Poke through the forums to find folks who might be interested in the topic or could give you some tasty feedback. Mention them in your post by attaching @ to their username. (For example, Dirk is @dirk).
- If you have pals with interest or expertise in this area, send them the link to Discourse and ask for their feedback and ideas.

This is a good opportunity to grow your network and to get other people to work with.

## Observe and Participate in Other Communities

The best way to build a quality community is to participate in other communities. Take a look at how other courses do it: 

- [Why Open](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/)
- [Writing for Change](http://writing4change.p2pu.org) 
- [Play With Your Music](http://playwithyourmusic.org) are good examples to look at.

Observe how..

- folks welcome new people to the community
- how community members interact with each other
- how they celebrate success
- how they give feedback to each other

Post your observations to Discourse under [Course in a Box: Community Safari](http://community.p2pu.org/t/course-in-a-box-community-safari/1153).
